# Truth Reconciliation Process

Navigate difficult conversations where conflicting truths must be acknowledged and reconciled without dismissing either party's experience or perspective.

## Purpose

When two people or groups hold conflicting but valid perspectives, this skill provides a framework for acknowledging both truths, finding common ground, and moving forward without requiring either party to abandon their core experience.

## When to Use

- Two parties are in conflict and both have legitimate points
- A situation requires acknowledging multiple valid perspectives
- Someone needs to apologize while also having valid reasons for their actions
- Historical or institutional harm requires acknowledgment without erasing complexity
- Moving forward requires understanding, not just agreeing

## Workflow

### Step 1: Acknowledge Each Truth Fully

**For each party, state:**
- What they experienced
- Why their experience is valid
- What they need acknowledged

**Critical:** Do this without "but" or qualification. Each truth stands alone first.

**Example:**
- Party A's truth: "You felt abandoned when I didn't respond for three days. That silence was painful and you didn't know what was happening."
- Party B's truth: "I was overwhelmed and needed space to process. Taking that time wasn't about rejecting you."

### Step 2: Identify the Collision Point

Where do these truths conflict? Name it explicitly.

**Example:** "The collision: A needed connection and communication. B needed silence and space. Both needs were legitimate. Both couldn't be fully met simultaneously."

### Step 3: Resist Resolution Pressure

Don't rush to "fix" the conflict. Sit with the tension.

**Acknowledge:**
- Sometimes truths conflict and that's real
- Understanding doesn't require agreement
- Some wounds don't heal cleanly

### Step 4: Find the Path Forward

**Options:**
- **Mutual understanding** - Both parties see why the other acted as they did
- **Agreed protocols** - "Next time, I'll send a brief message even when I need space"
- **Accepted difference** - "We handle stress differently; we can work with that"
- **Unresolved acknowledgment** - "This remains painful and we acknowledge that"

### Step 5: Close with Dignity

End in a way that preserves both parties' dignity and doesn't require anyone to be "wrong."

## Output Format

```markdown
## Truth Reconciliation: [Situation]

### Party A's Truth
[Their experience, fully acknowledged]

### Party B's Truth
[Their experience, fully acknowledged]

### The Collision
[Where these truths conflict]

### The Path Forward
[How to move forward honoring both]

### What Remains
[Any unresolved elements, honestly named]
```

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| One truth is actually false | This skill is for conflicting valid truths, not fact disputes |
| One party won't acknowledge the other | Note the limitation; reconciliation requires both parties |
| Harm was unequal | Acknowledge the asymmetry while still honoring both experiences |
| Resolution feels forced | Accept that some reconciliations are partial; that's honest |

## Constraints

- **Never false-equivalence** - Acknowledging both truths doesn't mean they're equally weighted
- **Don't force forgiveness** - Understanding isn't the same as forgiving
- **Honor complexity** - Simple situations don't need this process
- **Preserve dignity** - No one should leave feeling dismissed or diminished

## Key Principles

1. Both parties can be right about their own experience
2. Understanding why someone did something isn't approving of it
3. Reconciliation doesn't require agreement
4. Some truths will always be in tension
5. Moving forward doesn't mean moving past

**Remember:** The goal isn't to determine who was right. The goal is to acknowledge what happened, why it happened, and how to move forward with that understanding.
